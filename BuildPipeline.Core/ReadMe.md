# BuildPipeline.Core
This is the core library of the entire project,This library provides all basic functions.   
By calling BuilderFramework.Main and providing command line parameters, tasks can be run as an interfaceless process. Tools with GUI versions are also implemented based on this core library. If you want to develop a plug-in to implement your own tasks, then you also need to do it based on this library.
